Model_M2 was generated by fine-tuning Model_M1 using Labelled Set_S + Pseudolabelled Set_U1 + Pseudolabelled Set_U2.

Expected improvement was not seen.  Extra challenge of complexity if workflow is not continuous (lose records).

Next step:

Merge all unlabelled data into one set, and use to fine-tune Model_M.

If does not show improvement in metrics and workflow quality, add more labelled data.
